Additionally, a frequent use case involves externalizing these configurations. To demonstrate dynamic connector configuration, let's walk through building an application which iterates through a list of SFTP configurations and downloads/uploads files.","tags":["mft","connectors","sftp","mulesoft"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/dynamic-connector-config/"}},{"id":"a4bbfbb0-38a7-55bf-8377-ff074af9f5c5","frontmatter":{"title":"Optional Query Params via Dynamic SQL","date":"2020-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"When building APIs, we typically provide the ability to sort or filter data on GET operations via query parameters. While building basic query parameters in Mulesoft is simple, expanding your API to support optional and repeatable parameters can seem daunting when you're new to the platform. We will be building a simplistic Product System API in order to demo optional and repeatable query params. To accomplish this, we will be building dynamic (parameterized) SQL, and as a bonus wrapping this functionality into a reusable library.","tags":["dataweave","mulesoft","sql"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/optional-query-params-dynamic-sql/"}},{"id":"4dbbc89d-770b-5773-874a-76d864174249","frontmatter":{"title":"CI/CD with Mulesoft","date":"2020-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Demo video of CI/CD with Mulesoft and link to hands on lab.","tags":["devops","mulesoft","video"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/cicd-with-mulesoft/"}}]},"allTags":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"tags":["devops","mulesoft","video"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mft","connectors","sftp","mulesoft"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["dataweave","mulesoft"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["dataweave","mulesoft","sql"]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["devops","sftp","sql","video"],"tagSlugs":{"mft":"/tag/devops-mft-sftp-sql-video","connectors":"/tag/connectors-devops-sftp-sql-video","sftp":"/tag/devops-sql-video","mulesoft":"/tag/devops-mulesoft-sftp-sql-video","dataweave":"/tag/dataweave-devops-sftp-sql-video","sql":"/tag/devops-sftp-video","devops":"/tag/sftp-sql-video","video":"/tag/devops-sftp-sql"},"pubStates":[true],"pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":10,"numberOfPages":1,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1375839498","3128451518"]}

In this article, we will explore what Broken Object Level Authorization is, why it is a problem, and how to mitigate it. We will also provide a simple Python REST API example to demonstrate the impact of this vulnerability.","tags":["security","authorization","vulnerability"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2023/bola/"}},{"id":"e670812a-321c-5ea8-9338-6474ba8ea6da","frontmatter":{"title":"Working with the Mongodb Connector","date":"2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Translating MQL for use with the MongoDB connector can be confusing. In this post I'm going to attempt to explain several common use cases and how to implement them with the Mules 4 MongoDB Connector. Hopefully by the end you will also have a better idea about the thought process that goes into making the translation.","tags":["mongodb","mulesoft","dataweave"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/working-with-mongodb-connector/"}},{"id":"2232f77e-072b-5df5-98e7-0ff30ef36c13","frontmatter":{"title":"Dynamic Connector Configuration","date":"2020-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Frequently when building integrations, especially batch jobs, we don't necessarily know the configuration for all of the systems we will be connecting to ahead of time; the configurations are typically (and should be) externalized. While it doesn't feel intuitive, we can create a global configuration and use scoped variables to dynamically create new connector configurations at runtime.","tags":["mft","connectors","sftp","mulesoft"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/dynamic-connector-config/"}},{"id":"a2945bb3-98df-51b5-aee6-56f1cc9ba4bd","frontmatter":{"title":"Optional Query Params via Dynamic SQL","date":"2020-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"When building APIs, we typically provide the ability to sort or filter data on GET operations via query parameters. While building basic query parameters in MuleSoft is simple, expanding your API to support optional and repeatable parameters can seem daunting when you're new to the platform. We will be building a simplistic Product System API in order to demo optional and repeatable query params. To accomplish this, we will be building dynamic (parameterized) SQL, and as a bonus wrapping this functionality into a reusable library.","tags":["dataweave","mulesoft","sql"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/optional-query-params-dyanmic-sql/"}}]},"allTags":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"tags":["devops","mulesoft","video"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mft","connectors","sftp","mulesoft"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["dataweave","mulesoft"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["dataweave","mulesoft","sql"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mongodb","mulesoft","dataweave"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mulesoft","dataweave"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mulesoft","dataweave","streaming","memory"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["security","authorization","vulnerability"]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["connectors","mongodb","sftp","sql","vulnerability"],"tagSlugs":{"security":"/tag/connectors-mongodb-security-sftp-sql-vulnerability","authorization":"/tag/authorization-connectors-mongodb-sftp-sql-vulnerability","vulnerability":"/tag/connectors-mongodb-sftp-sql","mulesoft":"/tag/connectors-mongodb-mulesoft-sftp-sql-vulnerability","dataweave":"/tag/connectors-dataweave-mongodb-sftp-sql-vulnerability","streaming":"/tag/connectors-mongodb-sftp-sql-streaming-vulnerability","memory":"/tag/connectors-memory-mongodb-sftp-sql-vulnerability","mongodb":"/tag/connectors-sftp-sql-vulnerability","mft":"/tag/connectors-mft-mongodb-sftp-sql-vulnerability","connectors":"/tag/mongodb-sftp-sql-vulnerability","sftp":"/tag/connectors-mongodb-sql-vulnerability","sql":"/tag/connectors-mongodb-sftp-vulnerability","devops":"/tag/connectors-devops-mongodb-sftp-sql-vulnerability","video":"/tag/connectors-mongodb-sftp-sql-video-vulnerability"},"pubStates":[true],"pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":10,"numberOfPages":1,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1375839498","3128451518","324868815"]}

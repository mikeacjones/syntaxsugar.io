In this post I'm going to attempt to explain several common use cases and how to implement them with the Mules 4 MongoDB Connector. Hopefully by the end you will also have a better idea about the thought process that goes into making the translation.","tags":["mongodb","mulesoft","dataweave"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/working-with-mongodb-connector/"}},{"id":"a2945bb3-98df-51b5-aee6-56f1cc9ba4bd","frontmatter":{"title":"Optional Query Params via Dynamic SQL","date":"2020-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"When building APIs, we typically provide the ability to sort or filter data on GET operations via query parameters. While building basic query parameters in Mulesoft is simple, expanding your API to support optional and repeatable parameters can seem daunting when you're new to the platform. We will be building a simplistic Product System API in order to demo optional and repeatable query params. To accomplish this, we will be building dynamic (parameterized) SQL, and as a bonus wrapping this functionality into a reusable library.","tags":["dataweave","mulesoft","sql"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/optional-query-params-dyanmic-sql/"}},{"id":"063e7db3-f1d5-525b-ab21-a00192e3d422","frontmatter":{"title":"CI/CD with Mulesoft","date":"2020-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Demo video of CI/CD with Mulesoft and link to hands on lab.","tags":["devops","mulesoft","video"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/cicd-with-mulesoft/"}},{"id":"bc0150b2-0979-5f55-9385-34caff956972","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started with Data-Weave","date":"2020-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Need to get working with data-weave as fast as possible?

In a traditional approach, processing these files can involve issues around memory and time as it involves first downloading the entire file, attempting to load the entire file into memory to work on, and then saving the whole file to output. Instead of taking this old-fashioned approach, we can utilized data streaming and deferred DataWeave processing in order to streamline this process.","tags":["mulesoft","dataweave","streaming","memory"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2021/streaming-and-deferred-dw/"}},{"id":"2232f77e-072b-5df5-98e7-0ff30ef36c13","frontmatter":{"title":"Dynamic Connector Configuration","date":"2020-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Frequently when building integrations, especially batch jobs, we don't necessarily know the configuration for all of the systems we will be connecting to ahead of time; the configurations are typically (and should be) externalized. While it doesn't feel intuitive, we can create a global configuration and use scoped variables to dynamically create new connector configurations at runtime.","tags":["mft","connectors","sftp","mulesoft"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/dynamic-connector-config/"}},{"id":"a2945bb3-98df-51b5-aee6-56f1cc9ba4bd","frontmatter":{"title":"Optional Query Params via Dynamic SQL","date":"2020-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"When building APIs, we typically provide the ability to sort or filter data on GET operations via query parameters. While building basic query parameters in MuleSoft is simple, expanding your API to support optional and repeatable parameters can seem daunting when you're new to the platform. We will be building a simplistic Product System API in order to demo optional and repeatable query params. To accomplish this, we will be building dynamic (parameterized) SQL, and as a bonus wrapping this functionality into a reusable library.","tags":["dataweave","mulesoft","sql"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2020/optional-query-params-dyanmic-sql/"}}]},"allTags":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"tags":["devops","mulesoft","video"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mft","connectors","sftp","mulesoft"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["dataweave","mulesoft"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["dataweave","mulesoft","sql"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mongodb","mulesoft","dataweave"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mulesoft","dataweave"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["mulesoft","dataweave","streaming","memory"]}},{"frontmatter":{"tags":["security","authorization","vulnerability"]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tags":["connectors","memory","mft","sftp","sql"],"tagSlugs":{"security":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-security-sftp-sql","authorization":"/tag/authorization-connectors-memory-mft-sftp-sql","vulnerability":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-sftp-sql-vulnerability","mulesoft":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-mulesoft-sftp-sql","dataweave":"/tag/connectors-dataweave-memory-mft-sftp-sql","streaming":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-sftp-sql-streaming","memory":"/tag/connectors-mft-sftp-sql","mongodb":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-mongodb-sftp-sql","mft":"/tag/connectors-memory-sftp-sql","connectors":"/tag/memory-mft-sftp-sql","sftp":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-sql","sql":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-sftp","devops":"/tag/connectors-devops-memory-mft-sftp-sql","video":"/tag/connectors-memory-mft-sftp-sql-video"},"pubStates":[true],"pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":10,"numberOfPages":1,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1375839498","3128451518","324868815"]}

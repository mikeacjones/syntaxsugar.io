In this article, we will explore what Broken Object Level Authorization is, why it is a problem, and how to mitigate it. We will also provide a simple Python REST API example to demonstrate the impact of this vulnerability.","tags":["security","authorization","vulnerability"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2023/bola/"}},{"id":"8d8d93dc-4af0-58ad-9033-6584b849e1c6","frontmatter":{"title":"Streaming Data and Deferred Dataweave","date":"2021-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Processing data in an Enterprise environment frequently involves very large files. In a traditional approach, processing these files can involve issues around memory and time as it involves first downloading the entire file, attempting to load the entire file into memory to work on, and then saving the whole file to output. Instead of taking this old-fashioned approach, we can utilized data streaming and deferred DataWeave processing in order to streamline this process.","tags":["mulesoft","dataweave","streaming","memory"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2021/streaming-and-deferred-dw/"}},{"id":"e670812a-321c-5ea8-9338-6474ba8ea6da","frontmatter":{"title":"Working with the Mongodb Connector","date":"2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","shortDescription":"Translating MQL for use with the MongoDB connector can be confusing. In this post I'm going to attempt to explain several common use cases and how to implement them with the Mules 4 MongoDB Connector.

title: Creating Dataweave Modules

shortDescription: As your integration processes with MuleSoft mature, you'll find yourself using the data-weave language more and more. More importantly, you'll find yourself creating multiple functions which you'll want to reuse throughout your organization; in this article I will present two different ways in which you can create reusable data-weave libraries which can be included from your central maven repository, how to setup module unit tests, and how to perform line-by-line data-weave debugging.

# Dataweave Modules

## What are they?

Dataweave modules provide the same code library experience you're likely already used to. You've also likely already used a core module like this:

```data-weave{2}
%dw 2.0
import dw::core::Numbers

fun AND(lo: Number, ro: Number) = do {
    var binary = getBinary(lo, ro)
    ---
    Numbers::fromBinary(binary.left map ($ as Number * binary.right[$$] as Number) reduce ($$++$))
}
```

MuleSoft provides a large number of core functions and modules which we can leverage today; however, developers frequently find themselves creating functions which are utilized accross multiple applications. These might be common business logic functions, or functionality that MuleSoft hasn't implemented within the core modules. Instead of including the DWL files in each project individually and managing updates to these functions manually, we can bundle them into modules and publish them to our organization's Exchange or Maven repository. This allows us to include the common functionality via our POM, separating the function's common code from our specific application.

# Let's Build a JWT Module!

A large number of APIs require that we generate a signed JWT in order to authenticate. MuleSoft does not currently have a built in function/connector for this process, so we'll leverage functionality that already exists within dataweave to build our own reusable library.
